# Book Review: KR: Logical, Philosophical, and Computational Foundations [^1]

Sowa: [^2]
- "Knowledge representation is the application of logic and ontology to the task of constructing computable models for some domain"
- KR examples: rules, frames, semantic networks, object-oriented languages, Prolog, Java, SQL, Petri nets, KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format)
- field of KR usually calles "knowledge representation and reasoning" bc knowledge representation formalisms are useless without the ability to reason with them 
  - the choice of representation can have a major effect on the way the reasoning is arried out and on its ultimate success or failure
- to be a logic, a knowledge representation lanugage must have four essential features: Vocabulary ... Syntax ... Semantics... Rules of inference
- "Ontology ... is the study of existence, of all the kinds of entities––abstract and concrete––that make up the world...The two sources of ontological categories are observation and reasoning ... A choice of ontological categories is the first step in designing a database, a knowledge base, or an object-oriented system"
- "Knowledge engineering is the aplication of logic and ontology to the task of building computable models of some domain for some purpose"
- "Some of the knowledge in people's heads may be represented in propositions, more of it in imagelike forms, and the rest of it in habits, vague intuitions, and "gut feelings" that are never verbalized or visualized. Whatever its form, the knowledge is far too complex and disorganized to be called a knowledge base. Its fluid, geterogeneous, ever changing, and often inconsistent nature could be beter characterited as _knowledge soup_."


Shapiro: [^1]
- logic is not a particular knkowledge representation language, but is the study of correct reasoning
- KIF is machine-readable version of predicate logic designed for sharing knowledge bases among programs
