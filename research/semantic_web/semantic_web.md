# Semantic Web

- how to get the right information to the right people at the right time?
  - *explicit knowledge*: is information in the right context, i.e., information which can lead to effective action


## What is the Semantic Web?

- is/was envisioned as an extension of the current web where, in addition to being human-readable using WWW browsers, documents are annotated with meta-information [^1]
- meta-information defines what the information (document) is about in a machine processible way [^1]
- the explicit representation of meta-information, accompanied by domain theories (i.e. ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service [^1]
  - large network of human knowledge that's complemented with machine processability [^1]
  - various automated services will help the user achieve goals by accessing and providing information in machine-understandable form [^1]
  - #sym.arrow.r this process may ultimately create extremely knowledgeable systems with various specialized reasoning services, systems that can support us n nearly all aspects of life and that will become as necessary to us as access to electric power [^1]

- ontologies offer a way to cope with heterogeneous representations of web resources [^1]
- the domain model implicit in an ontology can be taken as a unifying structure for giving information a common representation and semantics [^1]


## An Architecture for Semantic Web-based Knowledge Management

Knowledge Acquisition
- automatic knowledge extraction from unstructured and semi-structured data in external data repositories [^1]
- support for human knowledge acquisition, knowledge engineers by ontology editing tools (support the creation, maintenance, population of ontologies) [^1]

Knowledge Representation
- ontology repository
  - represent acquired knowledge in an ontology language [^1]
  - later provide access to knowledge stored by providing a query language [^1]

Knowledge Maintenance
- ontology middleware with support for development, management, maintenance, use of knowldge bases [^1]

Knowledge Use
- information access tools to allow end users to exploit the knowledge represented in the system [^1]
  - includes facilities for finding, sharing, summarizing, visualitzing, browsing, organizing knowledge [^1]


## The role of ontologies

- interweave human understanding of symbols with their machine processibility [^1]
- developed in ai to facilitate knowledge sharing and re-use [^1]
- promise of ontologies: 'a shared and common understanding of a domain that can be communicated between people and application systems' [^1]
- #sym.arrow.r use of ontologies and supporting tools offer an opportunity to significantly improve knowledge management capabilities in large organizations [^1]
