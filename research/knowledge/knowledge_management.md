# Knowledge Management

? What is knowledge management?
- the set of procedures for producing, diseminating, utilizing, overseeing an organization's knowledge and data [^1]
- unites aspects of technology and organizational culture [^2]

- increasing amount of existing data makes it increasingly difficult to organize, find, access, maintain information required by the user [^2]
- as a possible solution: Tim Berners-Lee: idea/concept of a Semantic Web that provides enhanced infomation access based based on exploitation of machine-processable meta-data [^2]

- formal languages help to represent information in a highly structured way [^2]

? Why do we need knowledge management?
- in the post-industrial era, an organization's success is more dependent on its intellectual assets than on the value of its physical resources [^2]
  - largest companies by market capitalization (market cap) as at 2025-02-02 [^3]:
    + Apple
    + Microsoft
    + NVIDIA
    + Alphabet (Google)
    + Amazon
  - all of them can be attributed to knowledge in one way or another
- factors underlying this development: 
  - new technologies in technologies and communication, faster innovations in recent years, shorter product cycles, digitalization [^2]
  - mobile workforces, globalization which requires people to collaborate across the world [^2]

'knowledge is now the key battleground for competition' [^2]
- today:
  - information war on the internet, social media
  - spreading of misinformation
  - exertion of influence through given/restrained information

weaknesses of knowledge management systems:
- searching information
  - connecting information and their sources and allowing for synonyms etc. to be factored in, search could be more specific and performative [^2]
- extracting information
  - without automatic agents or agents in general possessing the common sense knowledge requires, extracting information from textual representations or integrating information has to be done through human browsing, reading etc. [^2]
- maintenance
  - maintaining weakly structured text sources is a difficult, time-consuming activity when sources become large [^2]
  - keeping such collections consistent, correct, up-to-date requires mechanized representation of the semantics that help to detect anomalies [^2]
- automatic document generation 
  - would enable adaptive websites that are dynamically reconfigured according to user profiles or aspects of relevance [^2]
  - generation of semi-structured information presentation from semi-structured data requires machine-accessible representation of the semantics of these information sources [^2]
