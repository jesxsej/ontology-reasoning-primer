# Knowledge

'Knowledge is power' (Francis Bacon)

- in terms of the Semantic Web: knowledge becomes distributed, dynamic and ubiquitous [^1]

- 'knowledge is now the key battleground for competition' [^2]

- knowledge can be created through building relationships, e.g. RDF [^2]

? What for do we went to digitalize knowledge?
1. for the people
    - with tacit knowledge, we can use tools to connect people with similar interests or concerns -> encouraging dialogue and opening up the possibility of the exchange of tacit knowledge [^2]
    - today: social media, personalization alogs in search etc.
2. AI
    - for an ai model to be able to reference real world domains
    - for a representation of the 'real world'

? Why ontologies?
- putting pieces of information or isolated information into a meaningful context <- implicit structures so reavealed, help users use and manage information more efficiently [^2]
