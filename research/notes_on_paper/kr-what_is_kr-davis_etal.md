# What is Knowledge Representation? [Davis et al.] [^1]

- sound inference does not free reasoning from error - one major problem is knowledge representation itself
- there is no way to build a perfect representation for a real world aspect/domain etc. bc it only is a surrogate, a copy/replica of the real thing, not the real thing itself
- a KR as an ontological commitment helps reasoning machines to keep focus an attention at what we deem is necessary for the task at hand
  - humans are biologically equipped with mechanism that handle attention and focus, so in carefully choosing a KR, we provide that feature to our machines
- ontologies offer a way to see some part of the world - but each for its own
  - <see: ontological commitment (ontogenesis)>
- the essence of an ontology is in its contents, not in the form it is written in BUT the expressivity of said ontology is determined by the underlying language
- not all possible representation technology is suitable for the chosen view of the world - we have to fit this view of the world into the terms of the chosen representation technology and thus further deepen the ontological commitment
- choosing a KR also means choosing a theory of intelligent reasoning -> by chossing a KR we choose reasoning capailities and constraints
  - in choosing a KR we choose more than a representation, we also select a conception of the fundamental nature of intelligent reasoning
  - and different conceptions of the nature of intelligent reasoning lead to deifferent goals, definitions of success, and different artifacts being created
- in addition you choose a set of sanctioned inferences, a set of inferences deemed appropriate conclusions to draw from the information available
- declarative languages (logic) may be a good choice to explicitly state facts and express to the T but they run into problems when trying to express implicit information about the reasoning strategy
- choosing a KR also comes with a certain computing efficiency -> it's important to choose a KE that is as easy to "speak" in and "understand" as possible, elsewise tehre might happen miss-communications
- representation and reasoning are inevitably intertwined - one can not talk about the one without regarding the other
- to built an intelligent reasoner, we also need a theory of intelligent inference
